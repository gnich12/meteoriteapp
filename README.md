## Chingu Prep Project Tier 3 

This application lets you search through Nasa's meteorite landing data set that you can find at this [url](https://data.nasa.gov/Space-Science/Meteorite-Landings/gh4g-9sfh)
When the application is loaded it will show a table with 100 items per page and it will load more results as you click next page.
